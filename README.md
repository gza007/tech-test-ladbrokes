## Instructions

I had to navigate a drone through the streets of a busy city.

The city has luckily been designed to have streets in a pure grid, that somehow stretches infinitely in every direction.

I have been given a specific set of directions that I needed to use to navigate the drone safely through the city.

I have received a set of instructions on how to use the directions given: 

* The drone you're piloting starts in the center of the city; at coordinates "0,0" facing "north".

* The directions given will contain the following information:

* Whether to turn left (L) or whether to turn right (R) by a complete 90 degrees.

* This will then be followed by a series of characters that indicate whether you should move forwards (+) or backwards (-).

## The mission 

The task is to pilot the drone safely through the city, following the directions given, and relay the coordinates that I
end up at.
